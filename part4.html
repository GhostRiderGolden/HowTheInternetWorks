                            <p>Information travels in packets of data, which is like a car, depending on the traffic you use different roads to get to the destination.</p>
                            <p>Data depending on the size can move at different parts, taking different routes and arriving at different times but once delivered they can reassemble to make the data whole again.</p>

                            <p>  When sending packets, the router chooses the cheapest available patches. “cheapest”: time – polycystic sand relationships between companies.</p>
                            <p>Most user do not see or care for Internet addresses. The Domain Name System, DNS, creates websites with corresponding addresses.</p>
                            <p> When a packet enters a router, a routing table (list containing routes to a specific network) can be used to determine the following hop address for the packet's source and destination address. Each packet may then be sent to the destination by a separate path, if necessary.</p>
