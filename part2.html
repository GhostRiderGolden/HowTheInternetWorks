    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The Internet basically works on binary; it moves around binary.   </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> “The Internet: A tangible physical system made to move information”. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The internet is made up of Bits, and it is either 0s and 1s. It is called Binary Code.
        We send bits through electricity, light, and radio </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Bandwidth is the maximum transmission capacity and that is measured with bitrate.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Bitrate is the number of bits per second that a system can send.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> Latency is the time that it takes for the sender to send the message to the reciever.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The benefits of using electricity would be that it is cheap, but there is a signal loss. </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The benefits for light would that it is fast and no signal loss, but it is expensive  </li>
    <li style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;"> The benefits of radio is that it is wireless, but there is signal loss.  </li>
