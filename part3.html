                            <p>Vent Cerf and Bob Khan invented the internet working protocol, this laid the ground for the internet.  </p>
                            <p>Internet is the network of the network. </p>
                            <p>Protocol is a well-known set of rules and standards used to communicate between machine without trouble.</p>

                            <p>All different devices on the internet have unique address. An address on the internet is just a number, that is unique to each device on the network.</p>
                            <p>One of the most important protocols used in internet communication. It is called IP Address.</p>
                            <p>Visiting a website is just your computer asking another computer for access to this information.</p>
                            <p>Each set of data is represented in bits. The traditional IP addresses are 32 bits long.</p>
                            <p>The earlier numbers identify the country/network and region/network. Then the subnetworks then finally the address of the specific device.</p>

                            <p>This version is called IPv4 – Designed in 1973 and used in the 1980s.</p>
                            <p> Due to the internet being so popular they are making a new IP called IPv6. Creating 340 Undecillion unique addresses.</p>
                            <p>Most user do not see or care for Internet addresses. The Domain Name System, DNS, creates websites with corresponding addresses.</p>
                            <p> DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy, so they can connect to millions of different addresses. For example, “. org, com, Edu”.</p>
